A Second Hand Car Price Prediction machine learning model using random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts the selling price of a used car based on various features such as car model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and so on. The model utilizes the random forest algorithm, a popular ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to produce more accurate and robust predictions.

The model is built using Python programming language and various data analysis and visualization libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The data is first collected and preprocessed to remove missing values, handle outliers, and encode categorical variables. Then, the data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Random forest is chosen as the best model for this problem as it has several advantages over other algorithms, such as handling non-linear relationships between features and avoiding overfitting. The model is trained using the training set and then tested on the testing set to assess its accuracy. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R-squared.

Finally, the model is deployed using Streamlit and used to predict the selling price of used cars based on the input features. The data analysis and visualization techniques used in this project help to gain insights into the data and visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable, which can aid in improving the model's performance.
